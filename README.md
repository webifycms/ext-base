# WebifyCMS Base Extension

> 👋 Hey there! We're still in the early stage of development, so you may not find all the features just yet. It's not quite ready for use in productions, but we'd love for you to give it a try, Don't mind to [log bugs](https://github.com/webifycms/ext-base/issues) and help us improve it! Thanks for your support.

The WebifyCMS base extension serves as the foundation for the entire application, holding abstractions and reusable components. It is adjusted as needed when new features are introduced.

Please refer to the installation guide [here](https://github.com/webifycms/app/blob/main/README.md#Quick-Start). It will be installed under the `extensions` 📁.
